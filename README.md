# AI-vs-Human-Detection-Python-for-data-science-project

The AI vs Human Content Detection chosen dataset is a real-world, multilingual benchmark designed to evaluate models that distinguish between human-written text, AI-generated text, and post-edited AI content across multiple domains.

As generative AI becomes deeply embedded in education, media, hiring, and marketing, detecting AI-generated content—especially human-edited AI text—has become increasingly difficult. Most existing datasets are English-only, model-specific, or quickly outdated.

This dataset addresses those limitations by providing diverse, prompt-aware, multi-model samples collected using modern LLMs and real human writing.

Use Cases

This dataset is suitable for:

1)AI vs Human text classification
2)Multi-class classification (Human / AI / Post-Edited AI)
3)Cross-model generalization testing
4)Multilingual AI detection
5)Domain-aware detection (education, news, email, social media, blogs)
6)Prompt leakage & prompt-style analysis
7)Benchmarking AI detection robustness
